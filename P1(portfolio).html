    <h1>NOOKALA VENKATA SAI SRAVANI</h1>
    <h2>SOFTWARE DEVELOPER</h2>
    <p>Enthusiastic and motivated engineering graduate with strong problem-solving skills and a solid foundation in ELECTRONICS AND COMMUNICATION ENGINEERING . Eager to apply academic knowledge in a professional setting and learn new technologies quickly.</p>
    <h2>PROJECTS</h2>
    <h3>Automatic street light monitoring</h3>
    <p>Automatic street light monitoring is a system that automatically controls and monitors street lights. It turns lights on or off based on conditions like ambient light, time of day, or motion detection—without human intervention.</p>
    <h3>An efficient ALU architecture for low power iot applications</h3>
    <p>An efficient Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) for low-power IoT applications is designed to minimize energy consumption while performing basic computations needed in smart devices. It uses optimized circuits, reduced bit-width operations, and simplified logic to lower power usage. Techniques like clock gating, operand isolation, and approximate computing help further cut power by disabling unused parts or allowing small errors that don’t affect results significantly in IoT scenarios.</p>
    <h3>Fire alarm</h3>
    <p>A fire alarm project is a safety system designed to detect smoke or high temperatures and alert people to potential fire hazards. It uses sensors (like smoke detectors, temperature sensors, or gas sensors) to monitor the environment. When a fire is detected, the system triggers an alarm—such as a buzzer, siren, or flashing light—to warn people immediately.</p>
